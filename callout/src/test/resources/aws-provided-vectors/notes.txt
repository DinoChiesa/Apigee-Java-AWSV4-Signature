I downloaded this from the AWS SDK test suite.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/samples/aws-sig-v4-test-suite.zip

For all of these test cases,

  accessKeyId = "AKIDEXAMPLE"
  secretAccessKey = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"


Needed to change data for one of the tests:
post-x-www-form-urlencoded

The test data was apparently incorrect.
